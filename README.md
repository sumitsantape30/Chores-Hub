## üéØ Purpose of the Project
 To begin with, like most employees, you have at least 20 different tasks and activities in your to-do list for the day. Now, not every task in your list holds the same significance or priority as the other. Some of them are urgent and some of them can easily be taken care of later in the day. This is where task management and time management prove most useful. Task management is deemed extremely important for every project manager and team because it allows them to keep a close eye on their priorities and become more productive each day.
 
    
## üìå Introduction 

- **Chores Hub** is a web based task managing application.
- It allows everyday users and businesses to manage their to-do lists in the most efficient manner.
- It provides you with the tool to **filter** the tasks based on your priority.
- If I click on the **add button(+)** a **modal** will be appeared on the screen, and I can enter the task in my modal/ticket. After adding the task I can set the priority of the task by choosing appropriate color.
- After you're done with entering task and choosing proper color, press on the **Shift key** and now my ticket will be generated. My each ticket will have a **unique id** and it's **Priority Color** on the top of the ticket.
- If you want to change the priority of the task you can do that by clicking on the color **strip on top of the ticket** and choose the color you wish to have that ticket.
- After generating a ticket the text in my ticket will be **read only**, since my ticket got locked after generating the ticket.
- If I want to **edit the task** then I need to unlock my ticket by clicking on the **lock icon**.
- After unlocking the ticket I can edit the task and lock the ticket again.
- If I add a ticket by default my ticket will have black color priority. 
- When you're done with your task and now want to **remove** that task, you can do that by clicking on the **X button**. After pressing the **X button** my remove button will be **activated**, now click on the ticket which you want to remove, and that ticket will be removed. For **deactivating the remove(X) button** click on the X button again and my remove button will be deactivated.
- Now suppose there are multiple tickets generated on my app and I want to see the **tasks of a particular priority only**, then I can do that by clicking on one of the priority **colors in toolbox** in the navbar. Now all of my tickets of the priority color I chose from toolbox will be appeared and now I can manage them.
- If I **double click** on any priority color then all of my tickets of all the priorities will be appeared on the screen.
- Let's say we have multiple tickets generated on the screen and now I refresh my screen, none of my tickets will be disappeared. Every ticket will be as it is with their priority color as well. As, they are stored in the **local storage of the browser**.
